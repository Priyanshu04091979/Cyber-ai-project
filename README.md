# Cyber-ai-project

The Cybersecurity AI platform is a scalable, India-focused SaaS solution designed to 
empower startups and MSMEs to protect their digital assets effectively. It leverages 
cutting-edge machine learning models trained on Indian cyber threat data to detect 
anomalies, automate threat response, and provide continuous risk visibility. The 
platform aids compliance with emerging Indian cybersecurity regulations and supports 
cyber insurance readiness, offering an affordable, user-friendly solution tailored to 
India’s growing digital economy.


1. AI Threat Detection & Incident Response 
• Localized Machine Learning Models: Leverages large datasets of Indian cyber 
threat patterns including malware, phishing, ransomware, and emerging attack 
vectors. Models adapt to new threats with continuous learning. 
• Anomaly Detection: Real-time monitoring of network traffic, user behavior, and 
system logs to spot deviations indicative of cyberattacks or insider threats. 
• Automated Mitigation: Predefined automated actions like IP blocking, 
quarantining suspicious files, and temporarily isolating compromised endpoints 
to reduce response times. 
• Alerting & Notification: Multi-channel alerts (email, SMS, app notifications) to IT 
admins and stakeholders for timely intervention. 
• Incident Forensics: Logs and visualizes attack timelines and affected assets to 
support investigation and reporting.
